**Drektheth Powder:** Commonly referred as '**Dragon Dust**'. A golden powder with the same consistency of flour, the drug is overly bitter. After consumption, it makes the user feel much stronger than before, although no actual physical change takes place. The drug is also known to cause shifts in personality, usually making the user act boastful and haughty while under its effects. Sometimes this change will carry over into soberness as well for `dice: 1d8` hours.
