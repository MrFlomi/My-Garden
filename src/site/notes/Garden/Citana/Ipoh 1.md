# Description
The Ipoh are a tribe of Kalshtar who wander the western lands, to and from the great forest. As a small tribe of only a few families, their traditions center on collecting things from wherever they go and whoever they meet – gathering and preserving knowledge. As a wandering people they carry only select material items, and retain everything else as stories they tell or act out.

The Ipoh believe that dreams are an extension of reality, an opportunity to travel other realms and communicate with ancestors and spirit guides. According to the Ipoh, a person has two souls – one of them animates the physical body and the other one extends beyond physical activities. In sleep, the soul travels and when it returns to the body it communicates its experiences and learning through dreams. Traveling to the astral plane, the soul can communicate with other souls, animals or other entities to receive guidance. It is necessary to learn from these dream adventures to unify these two souls and make the person whole again, and to learn and grow. People are encouraged to remember their dreams and seek help from Shamans to interpret the meaning of their dreams to progress on their spiritual journey.

The Ipoh are known for their skill in weaving, and they create intricate and beautiful tapestries and garments from the materials they collect on their travels. They are also skilled at carving and sculpting, and they use wood, stone, and other materials to create beautiful and ornate objects and totems.

The Ipoh have a rich oral tradition, and they pass down their stories, legends, and history through storytelling and song. They are known for their skill at improvising and creating new stories, and they often use their performances to entertain and educate others.

The Ipoh place a great emphasis on community and cooperation, and they work together to care for and support each other. They are a small and tight-knit tribe, and they value the bonds of family and friendship above all else.

The Ipoh believe that the world is full of spirits and forces that can influence and shape their lives, and they are skilled at communing with these spirits and seeking their guidance. They believe that the spirits of the land, the animals, and the ancestors can provide valuable insight and wisdom, and they often seek their counsel in times of need.

The Ipoh are known for their wisdom and their ability to see the interconnectedness of all things. They believe that everything is connected, and that by understanding and respecting the connections between people, animals, and the land, they can create harmony and balance in the world.

When two Ipoh meet, they might greet each other by saying something like "Blessings upon you. Have you had any interesting dreams lately?" This greeting would show that the Ipoh value dreams and see them as an important part of their culture and spirituality.

In response to this greeting, the other person might describe a recent dream that they had, or they might ask the first person about their own dreams. The conversation might continue with both people sharing their dreams and discussing their meanings and significance. This conversation would not only serve as a greeting, but it would also provide an opportunity for the Ipoh to learn from each other's dreams and to gain insight and wisdom from their shared experiences.

Overall, this greeting would show the importance of dreams in the Ipoh culture, and it would provide an opportunity for the Ipoh to connect with each other and to share their experiences and knowledge.

# Path of Light
-   We live in an age of darkness. We must find the path that leads to the light.
-   Act with compassion and courage. Each noble act is a step on the path.
-   Hone your body and your mind. You are the tool you will use to change reality.

Practiced by many kalashtar, the Path of Light seeks to change reality by first bringing change within, using meditation to focus the mind and athletic discipline to improve the body. The next step brings light into the world, using courage and compassion to banish the darkness in the people around you. Mediate disputes. Extinguish hatred by guiding people out of darkness. Inspire people to be better than they are. Even the smallest change is a victory, yet lightbringers—the followers of this path—hope that this is merely a step on a greater journey.

The Path of Light teaches that this age is dominated by il-Lashtavar, “the great darkness that dreams.” This force poisons the world and promotes darkness. But all things change. If enough light can enter the world, it will lead to a tidal shift: the age of il-Lashtavar will end and usher in the time of il-Yannah, the great light.

Some followers of this faith believe that meditation alone is sufficient to change the path of the world, that merely contemplating the light is sufficient to bring about the change. Most believe that it is necessary to take action, but that darkness must fought with light. Violence is never the answer, and the only way to defeat evil is to redeem it. Lightbringers seek to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those whose evil is driven by ignorance. The faith has followed this path for over a thousand years, but now a splinter sect advocates greater action. These shadow watchers believe that evil must be fought, that sources of darkness that poison communities can and should be ruthlessly eliminated.

The Path of Light is taught to the kalashtar by the spirits bound to their bloodlines. It is widespread in the nation of Adar in distant Sarlona, but in Khorvaire, it is largely unknown outside kalashtar communities. The shadow watchers champion a sect born in Khorvaire, and the elders of Adar have condemned its methods.

If you follow the Path of Light, you must choose your side. As a lightbringer, you seek to spread hope and goodwill. As a shadow watcher, you hunt down and eliminate sources of darkness. Which path will you follow?

### Symbol

The symbol of the Path of Light is a shard of brilliant crystal, carried or worn as an amulet. This crystal may be used as a holy symbol; if it’s worn as a necklace, the priest must place one hand on it to use it as a focus. The formal garb of a priest includes a headdress with curving horns and points made from a Sarlonan shell-like material called sentira.

### Rites

Physical and mental discipline are important virtues of the Path of Light. Martial arts and guided meditation become a form of devotion and prayer. A kalashtar priest conducts services telepathically, using shrines designed to amplify psychic abilities and allowing them to share thoughts and images directly with the congregation. To an outsider, a service can appear silent and tranquil despite being an ecstatic experience for the faithful.
